Ubisoft Game Security Program

Description
The Ubisoft Game Security Program provides a dedicated channel for reporting security issues that affect Ubisoft video games and their related online services — including game clients, consoles, PC builds, back-end game servers, matchmaking, in‑game economies, and game‑specific APIs. This program is focused exclusively on game titles; corporate infrastructure should be reported via the Corporate Security Program.

We encourage careful, good‑faith research and concise reports with reproducible steps and the minimal evidence required to show impact. Wherever possible, test on isolated environments or use disposable/test accounts — do not interfere with live matches or other players' experiences. Extracting or exposing player personal data will not be tolerated, and do not publish findings publicly until they are remediated or approved for disclosure.

Prohibited activities include social engineering, physical intrusion, creating or distributing cheats or bypasses for anti‑cheat systems, manipulating live economies to harm players, or any actions that materially disrupt gameplay or services.

When reporting, provide clear reproduction steps, affected platform/version, PoC where safe, and any relevant logs or captures. Our Security team will acknowledge submissions, investigate promptly, keep reporters informed, and offer recognition consistent with program policies.

To facilitate easier bug reproduction, we ask that a hash or version of the game being exploited be included in the report. Additionally, in the PoC source code, if hardcoded Virtual Addresses are used, include a comment specifying the corresponding Relative Virtual Addresses and offsets of the manipulated functions/objects.

To submit a report, please use Intigriti so we can review and remediate quickly.
