Game Security Bug Bounty Program (Example)

Description
This is a sample game security bug bounty program for testing purposes.
The program accepts security vulnerability reports for game applications,
APIs, backend servers, and related infrastructure.

We encourage responsible disclosure and good-faith security research.
Test on isolated environments or test accounts only. Do not interfere
with live services or player data.

Prohibited activities include social engineering, physical intrusion,
creating cheats or anti-cheat bypasses, and disrupting gameplay.

When reporting, provide clear reproduction steps, affected versions,
POC where safe, and relevant logs or evidence.
