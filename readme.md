## ‚ú® Features

- **OWASP Top 10 Coverage**: Scans for vulnerabilities based on OWASP Top 10 (2021)
- **Subdomain Discovery**: Identifies and scans subdomains of the target
- **Multi-threaded Scanning**: Parallel scanning for improved performance
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive JSON reports and console summaries
- **Low False Positive Rate**: Designed to minimize false positives through validation checks

## üîé Security Checks

The scanner performs comprehensive checks for:

- **Authentication Failures**: Login security, brute force protection, account enumeration
- **Cryptographic Failures**: SSL/TLS issues, insecure cookies, missing security headers
- **Injection Vulnerabilities**: SQL, XSS, and command injection points
- **Insecure Design**: User enumeration, rate limiting, default credentials
- **Security Misconfigurations**: Information leakage, dangerous HTTP methods
- **Vulnerable Components**: Outdated libraries, exposed server information
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Missing CSP, SRI checks, cache poisoning vectors
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Exposed logs, monitoring endpoints, log injection
- **SSRF Vulnerabilities**: URL parameters, form fields, and header-based vectors
